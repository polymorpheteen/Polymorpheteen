<h1 align="center">Welcome ( ⸝⸝•ᴗ•⸝⸝ )੭⁾⁾</h1>

<div align="left">

  <p>
    I’m someone who loves turning ideas into real, working things on the internet. I build, experiment, and ship whatever I’m excited about. Whether it’s a weird idea, a tool, or something I probably should’ve slept before coding.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You’ll find a handful of projects here. I’m always working on something new behind the scenes.
  </p>

  <p>
    When I’m not coding, you’ll catch me exploring new concepts, sketching ideas, or getting lost in whatever hobby is currently absorbing me.
